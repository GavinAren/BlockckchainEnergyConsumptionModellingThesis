\section {Defining Metrics}


\section {Data Gathering}

Couldn't use the API, had to scrape from the API. Data was annualised for each day's estimate, had to be divided by 365. Could explain why this makes sense sccoriding to their equation, maybe they multiplied by 365, or when they measured energy in the experiment for 2 days, they multiplied by 365/2.

\section {Modelling The Energy Consumption}

*Define everything in your modelling world, what your definition of everything is

\section {Modelling The Carbon Emissions }
* Advice was to make the model, logcally make the equations, justify each assumption etc, then gather some data for it, apply the data see what output you get. Then implement other's models using this data. Finally compare results, say why your model was/was not accurate.

*must be done right here, not later

Couldn't use CCRI API as it wasn't ready yet. Has to scrape it from the website from the network section.
