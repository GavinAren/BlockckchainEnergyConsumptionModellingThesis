\section{Motivations}

\subsection{Research Question}

Using electricity consumption as a proxy of environmental impact, what is the environmental impact of Ethereum 2.0's Proof-of-Stake protocol in comparison to its previous Proof-of-Work protocol and other traditional transactional systems?

\subsection{Motivation}

Over 70\% of all blockchain projects are built on Ethereum (from infura Ethereum page)

\section{Novel Contributions}

no one has looked into predicting energy based on the number of validators which is an easily available stat but its behaviour has not been analysed
only 1 other paper focuses on doing exactly this and this paper added 2 important components their equation does not take into account

its a new area, contributed to the data out there, appendix has some extra data others can use and save time
