\section{Chapter Summary}
\section {Key Factors And Limitations}


\paragraph
Energy usage of the defined hardware specification mentioned is denoted by:
\begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}
\end{equation*} 

A Consensus Layer Client's energy usage is denoted by subscript:
\begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}_{CL}}
\end{equation*}

An Execution Layer Client's energy usage is denoted by subscript:
\begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}_{EL}}
\end{equation*}
 
 An Idle client's energy usage is denoted by: \begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}_{ID}}
\end{equation*} 

Mean Energy usage for each of the 3 client types are denoted by the following respectively: 
\begin{equation*}
  \boldsymbol{\mathrm{{\overline{E}}_{CL}}}\quad      \boldsymbol{\mathrm{{\overline{E}}_{EL}}}\quad  \boldsymbol{\mathrm{{\overline{E}}_{ID}}}   
\end{equation*}

The number of machines ran with different combinations of consensus and execution layer clients is denoted by:
\begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{n}
\end{equation*}

The known share of the network that uses a specific combination of Consensus and Execution layer client is denoted by:
\begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{\phi}_{i} \text{ where } {i} \text{ represents a specific CL and EL client combination.}
\end{equation*}

The total share of the network occupied by ${n}$ tested combinations of consensus and execution layer clients is denoted by:
\begin{equation*}
    \boldsymbol{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\phi_{i}}}
\end{equation*}

\textit{Model 1}
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\frac{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{ \left({\left(\mathrm{\overline{E}}_{ID} + \mathrm{\overline{E}}_{CL} + \mathrm{\overline{E}}_{EL}\right)} * {\phi_{i}} \right)}}
 {\pi}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Discussion}
*So I did it this way, could've been done another way. Due to my method, could've affected results
* self reflection -> smaller factors not considered, maybe if I used a differet group of numbers/users some other result would have been achieved, loopholes


Couldn't use API - may have affected accuracy of data, couldv'e been live data, more precise data
